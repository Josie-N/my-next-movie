    How pagination is calculated - steps:

    1. Calculate total number of pages available

    This step is done on the backend side (not by the React app)

    const totalPageCount = Math.ceil(totalNumberOfMovies / moviesPerPage);
    Example: 100 movies / 5 movies per page ⟹ 20 pages available
    Final output received: one number


    2. Calculate the range of page numbers visible on the screen

    Max. 2 to 5 number of pages available on the screen (out of 50 or more total pages)
    Pagination format: N-2 | N-1 | current page = N | N+1 | N+2
    Example: 9 | 10 | current page = 11 | 12 | 13

    Calculate N-2 and N+2. We need 'totalPageCount' value for this (calculated in Step 1).
    Final output: two numbers


    3. Store the page range numbers in a new array

    The data type needs to be changed in order to be able to map through it,
    from a number (integer) to an array of integers.

    const pageNumberRange = _.range(N-2, N+2 + 1);

    Example: _.range(3, 50)  ⟹ is converted to: [ 3, ... , 49]; (50 is not included, you need to add '+ 1')
    Final output: one array of integers


    4. Map over the array of numbers created

    Each individual page number can now be rendered to the screen:
    pageNumberRange.map( pageNumber => (
       <ul>
         <li>
           <a>{pageNumber}</a>
         </li>
       </ul>
    ));

    Final output: unordered list of <li> html tags (via React)
